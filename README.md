# Why?

This is a kinda small and relativley new game and I couldnt find any good menus/scripts for it specifically so I decided to make one. This uses the Venyx menu lib since im dumb, lazy, and didnt want to make my own menu. Very good for beginners (like me). This is mt first time releasing one of the scripts I make since most of them kinda suck and are very badly coded as im relativley new to lua. Anyways, hope you enjoy and ill probably be updating this for a bit.
