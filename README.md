# Jailbird.GG

Script/GUI for the game Jailbird.

!! -> This script is still a W.I.P so things are expected to be a bit scuffed <- !!

Released full source for the menu because I dont want to work on it avidly anymore. Expect sparse updates and minor changes and tweaks here and there. Ill try and work on optimization if I do end up working on the script in the future since its in no way optimized.
